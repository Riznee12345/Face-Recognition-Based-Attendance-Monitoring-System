## 🚀 Overview

The Face Recognition Attendance Monitoring System leverages the power of computer vision and machine learning to identify individuals in real time and mark attendance automatically. This system eliminates the manual process of attendance-taking, enhances security, and ensures reliability by reducing proxy attendance.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- 🔍 Real-time face detection and recognition using OpenCV
- 🧠 Machine Learning model training using LBPH / Haarcascade / DNN (based on your codebase)
- 📝 Automatic attendance logging with timestamps
- 📊 GUI interface for admin control
- 🗃️ Student database management
- 📤 Attendance export to Excel/CSV files
- 🔒 Secure and tamper-proof system design

---

## 💡 How It Works
- Register Student: Capture face images using a webcam and assign an ID/name.
- Train Model: Process the captured images to train a face recognition model.
- Recognize Faces: The system detects and recognizes faces in real time.
- Mark Attendance: If recognized, attendance is marked in a CSV file with time and date.
